## About the program

## Installation
If you want to use the program, download the jar file in the dist folder and use that.  I plan to keep that up to date with any changes I make to the program.

If you want the source code, its all in the src folder, each folder in there is a package.  I wrote this program using the netbeans editor which created the forms for the GUI components.
